# ArrayFunctions
The main application reads arrays of integers from a file, processes them to determine the largest, smallest, average, and median values, and then prints out these results. Additionally, there's a test suite to ensure that the library functions operate correctly, demonstrating their application on a range of scenarios, from basic small arrays to more complex use cases, such as arrays filled with large numbers and dynamically allocated memory arrays.
